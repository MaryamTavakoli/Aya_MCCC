# It’s Already Hot! – Quick tips for taking immediate action

**Is an extreme heat event already here, and so you don’t have time to plan together with neighbours? Here are some quick tips for ways to stay safe now—and help your neighbours, too.**

## Cool quickly
- Submerge your feet and legs in cold water.
- Cover your skin with wet clothes or towels.
- Mist yourself with a spray bottle filled with water.
- Place a layer of cardboard or tin foil to help block sunny windows.
- Go to the lowest floor or basement of the building you’re in, or seek out a public “cool” zone such as a cooling centre, a public library, shopping mall, or community centre.
- If you go outdoors, take rest often in shaded or cooler areas such as large treed parks or near a body of water.

## Get more cooling advice
- Jump to Step 3 in this guide, “Learn about the risks,” to find more safety instructions, tips and resources for extreme heat.

## Distribute information, alerts and tips to neighbours
- Print out and knock on doors to distribute all or part of this guide, post an extreme heat safety resource in an apartment lobby, laundry room, or neighbourhood bulletin board.
- Deliver information to people in their mailboxes, or make use of any other communication channels you already have with neighbours.

# Plan Ahead! – Prepare with neighbours for extreme heat

## Step 1: Reach Out

Start by finding and gathering fellow neighbours who are also interested in discussing and planning for extreme heat. Ask a few neighbours whom you already know to help spread the word, put invitation posters in common areas, or hand out flyers door-to-door. Suggest that people respond, so you know how many to expect. You might find this sample Invitation to Neighbour-to-Neighbour Heat Planning (forthcoming) helpful for reaching out to neighbours.

**Note:** If you’d rather just try to gather neighbours for a specific action first (rather than gathering to decide on possible activities), you can jump to Step 5!

**TIP:**
If you would like more tips on how to engage your neighbours, see Building Resilient Neighbourhoods’ guide Engage Your Neighbours (forthcoming).

## Step 2: Gather Neighbours

Meet with fellow neighbours in a common space or someone’s home, or online using Zoom, Messenger, Skype, or another meeting platform. It’s usually easiest to meet in person, but if it’s necessary to meet online, be sure to ask people when they respond what technologies they are comfortable with.

## Step 3: Learn about the risks of extreme heat

Consider circulating a copy of this guide, or some of the educational materials about extreme heat listed below, to participants ahead of the meeting. Alternatively, allow time at the meeting for everyone to read through a selection of the materials below.

# What You Need to Know about Extreme Heat

“Extreme heat” is said to occur when high temperatures pose serious risks to human health. Many homes and cities in BC were not designed for managing extreme heat; so, in general, experts suggest to be on alert when daytime and overnight temperatures are higher than seasonal norms for your area, and may also be rising each day.

Due to climate changes, extreme heat events in BC are expected to become hotter, last longer, and occur more often in future. Some people are at higher risks than others, and effects on human health can range from mild heat rashes and fatigue to heat stroke and even death.

## Risk factors during heat events include:
- Living alone
- Living on hotter upper floors
- Lack of air filters or air conditioners
- Limited mobility
- Pregnancy
- Certain medications and/or substance use
- Infancy or older age (65+)
- Disabilities
- Current illness or pre-existing chronic ailments
- Living in south- or west-facing units

**Prolonged heat may also cause mental fogging and confusion, making it difficult for a person to help themselves. So, one of the best ways to stay safe is to know the risks and check in on each other during hot weather – This is how neighbours preparing together can help save lives!**

# Step 4: Discuss Concerns

After reading some of the educational materials, discuss some of your biggest concerns about extreme heat.

Consider these questions:
- How concerned are you personally about extreme heat?
- Are you concerned for neighbours who might be at higher risk?
- Have you or someone you know had negative experiences in extreme heat?
- Would you feel comfortable sharing your specific health concerns or hearing those of a neighbour, so that you could more effectively and safely check in with each other during a heat event?

# Step 5: Explore Opportunities for Action

Consider the possible options for action below – and of course feel free to come up with some of your own ideas for actions! Take some time to “brainstorm” about, and reflect on, each option before trying to make any final decisions. If you’re discussing options together with neighbours, assign a note-taker to record the most important ideas and reflections and identify what “roles” different people would need to play to help make something happen. You might find it helpful to complete Building Resilient Neighbourhoods’ Prepare Together for Extreme Heat template (forthcoming).

## Some options to consider...

### Promote neighbour-to-neighbour learning
Host an educational talk, inviting a local expert to speak about extreme heat and safety planning, or distribute heat-awareness materials to neighbours.

**Consider these questions:**
- Is there a local emergency management agency, nonprofit, or health authority with speakers and/or educational materials available?
- Where could someone speak, and what equipment might be needed?
- How will we copy and distribute materials?
- Are there local businesses that have a hall to talk or distribute materials, such as from a building manager or strata council?
- Are there other types of educational activities that are possible?

## Set up a neighbour-to-neighbour communication system

Regular check-ins with neighbours can be life-saving during extreme heat events. Any neighbour-to-neighbour communication method, such as a buddy system, email list, online group, phone tree, door-hanger messaging system, or a lobby message board can be an effective way to check in on each other, share important health information, or match people's needs with offers for assistance among neighbours.

**Consider these questions:**
- What method could we use for checking on each other? Are there any existing communication channels we could use (e.g. Block Watch, strata lists, committees)? Is there anything that could "go wrong" with this method that we should be mindful of (e.g. electricity failure during emergency)?
- What points of contact and what information would be helpful to share during heat events, and how would we share them? (For example, signing up for a government alert system such as WeatherCAN).
- If neighbours need extra support or assistance during heat events, are there ways that neighbours can offer such assistance, how can those people get connected?
- In any activities we choose, what roles would people need to take on?

**TIP:**
For more information and instructions, see the Building Resilient Neighbourhoods guides Build a Neighbour-to-Neighbour Communication System (forthcoming), Build a Buddy System, and Be a Buddy (forthcoming).

## Find or create safe cooling zones

Identify safe cooling zones in the building or in the neighbourhood where people are able to go, such as shopping malls, libraries, basement spaces, or common rooms that can be cooled.

**Consider these questions:**
- Are there shady green spaces or air-conditioned public buildings or cooling centres nearby? Who is allowed to use them (e.g. pets), and how easy is it to get to them? Does your community have a map of cooling centres you can share with neighbours, including a list of hours, rules, and available amenities for pets?
- Does your home have one cooler area, such as a common space or part of a corridor that could be made cooler for a few hours of the day, where neighbours might gather, while still maintaining health guidelines?
- Does anyone nearby know, or has a good space, that might be willing to invite neighbours over for a cool break?
- Could portable fans or coolers be shared among neighbours during heat events?
- Could neighbours install shades (or blankets) in windows, or help do other simple temporary or permanent fixes before or during extreme heat events? How can such opportunities be identified and communicated?

## Build “cool kits”

Does everyone have the supplies they need to stay cool during heat events, and could some supplies be better purchased together and distributed to neighbours? Review the suggestions in the Building Resilient Neighbourhoods Cool Kit Supplies List (forthcoming). Make it more fun by hosting a “cool kit party” and inviting neighbours to help assemble and distribute the kits!

**Consider these questions:**
- How will we purchase the supplies? Are there any local small grants available to help with this?
- How will we decide what items to get?
- How will we invite our neighbours to participate?
- How will we assemble and distribute the heat kits, and who can help hand them out?

## Step 6: Take action and learn together!

Select one or two priority actions to try with your neighbours. After the next heat event, get together to debrief and learn about what actions worked well and what you might do differently next time to help keep each other safe.
